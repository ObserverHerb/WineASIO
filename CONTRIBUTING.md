This fork was born out of a desperate need to "scratch my own itch" and get WineASIO up-to-date so I can continue playing my guitar through my Linux machine. If you find yourself in the same position, I'm happy to review your own scratches for inclusion here. Just open a pull request or contact me directly at hmillerj@gmail.com. You can also usually find me on IRC in #winehq or #gentoo-wine on the Freenode server.
